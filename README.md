# ðŸ’» My portfolio website

It is v2 because I have coded one previously, but it never made it to production since my first portfolio lacked responsiveness. Hence, I wanted to start over with a new design to include a responsive design and write in a framework that I am more proficient in compared to back then. I was able to learn more about responsive designs and improve my Figma skills from this portfolio. ðŸ˜Š
